Echo Robot Simulation

Echo Robot is a ROS 2-based robotics simulation project featuring a fully 3D-modeled robot integrated with Gazebo and RViz. The robot is equipped with a LiDAR scanner, enabling mapping with SLAM Toolbox and autonomous navigation using Nav2. The project showcases a complete simulation workflow, including teleoperation, SLAM-based mapping, and goal-directed navigation.
